# FossFlic

Too many people hanging around the foosball table? Foosball is amazing but sharing a foosball table between lots of friends/colleagues can be tricky.

This app helps organize teams and matches on a first-in-first-out basis, where the winner team stays and the looser team is replaced by the two players waiting for longer time. Flic smart buttons can be placed on the foosball table and used to send goals to the scoreboard. The app keeps statistics of the current game session, tracking scored goals, won matches, etc.
